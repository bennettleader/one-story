                <p>Recognizing that non-profits, foundations and companies have a need to demonstrate  their work’s vital role in the community, One Story Productions launched in 2007. 
For each client we create a unique brand development plan. First we sit down together. We document goals and expectations based on an understanding of what’s important and how a brand film can best fit within larger marketing / brand strategy. </p>
                <p>Through collaboration, we create visual voices that tell real stories. 
Production services can span from a one-man crew to a 10-person production. Post-production is detailed and unique—this is where the story takes shape, so we work with clients until they love the final products.

                    <p>Aaron is the founder and principal at One Story Productions. He has worked with over 100 organizations to tell their authentic story through the production of films. His passion for cause-related films has taken him around the world to reveal stories that need to be experienced.</p>  
                    
<p>In 2007 on a trip to capture the story of an Arts Conservatory in India, Aaron recognized that nonprofit organizations stand up for people who don’t have a voice. It’s his belief that these organizations create awareness, innovation and change and have an empowering story that deserves to be told. Documentary filmmaking plays a very similar role as nonprofits as these nonprofits and change is possible. </p>
                    
<p>Aaron actively builds the One Story Production’s community involvement through speaking roles and as a freelance director. Aaron takes on many roles, working with agencies and consulting. As an expert in the field, he shows organizations the value of telling stories through this medium. </p>

                                        <p>One Story and Aaron Weiss are the shepherds of our story at IT’S TIME TEXAS.  As a cause, our success is dependent upon our ability to authentically capture and harness the stories of those with whom we work and are honored to serve.  We, therefore, hold storytelling, especially through the medium of video, in the highest regard.</p>
                                        <p>While storytelling is one of the oldest human traditions, it takes a special talent to be able to collect often diverse and distinct stories and weave together a coherent and compelling narrative that remains true to all individual contributors.  We are so fortunate to have found that rare talent in Aaron and One Story.  With One Story, we know that IT’S TIME TEXAS’ story is in very good hands.</p>

                                        <p>One Story Productions has been an invaluable partner in the documentation and development of Allegiance - A New American musical, through all of its stages. Sing Out Louise Productions partnered with One Story Productions to shoot high-quality filmed version of each developmental productions, readings, workshop, etc. of Allegiance which at each stage allowed the creative team to review and further improve the work, as well as proving an amazingly effective instrument to showcase the production to potential investors, producers and partners, with great effect, and maintaining costs under control. Each production was professionally and skillfully realized, keeping time and cost to a minimum, and Aaron Weiss and his collaborators worked diligently with our producers to satisfy the storytelling needs and providing a final product of the highest quality. There is question that we would be working with OSP again.</p>
