<h2 class="heading-b heading-major">Background</h2>
<p>One Story Productions has travelled around the state to produce projects that help IT’S TIME TEXAS unite and mobilize individuals, institutions, and organizations to build healthier communities.</p>

<p>We have worked hand-in-hand with IT’S TIME TEXAS staff since its launch. In doing so, One Story Productions has been instrumental in establishing the brand voice, providing consultation on project development, and growing the cause into what it is today. </p>

<p>As of 2014, One Story Production’s work for IT’S TIME TEXAS has been in front of the nearly 4.5 million Texas who’ve joined the cause to date.</p>

<p>Poised to continue, this impactful partnership will continue to grow and touch millions of Texans in years to come.</p>

<h2 class="heading-b heading-major">Outcome</h2>
<p>“One Story and Aaron Weiss are the shepherds of our story at IT’S TIME TEXAS.  As a cause, our success is dependent upon our ability to authentically capture and harness the stories of those with whom we work and are honored to serve.  We, therefore, hold storytelling, especially through the medium of video, in the highest regard.</p>
 
<p>While storytelling is one of the oldest human traditions, it takes a special talent to be able to collect often diverse and distinct stories and weave together a coherent and compelling narrative that remains true to all individual contributors.  We are so fortunate to have found that rare talent in Aaron and One Story.  With One Story, we know that IT’S TIME TEXAS’ story is in very good hands.”</p>
