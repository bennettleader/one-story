<h2 class="heading-b heading-major">Background</h2>

<p>UNESCO's International Fund for Cultural Diversity (IFCD) selected One Story Productions from eight finalist agencies on four continents to embark on a global awareness-building campaign built around four documentary-shorts.</p>

<p>After traveling to Senegal, Argentina, and Croatia, we produced four films, each of which has an English, Spanish and French version. The work culminated with a presentation of the films at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris.</p>

<p>These films are intended to garner financial support for viewers. So One Story Productions led the development of a partnership with Austin Texas’ Wyatt Brand; together the organizations developed a global PR campaign that ensure the films will reach the audience who needs to see them—decision-makers.</p>

<p>As our largest and most expansive project to date, it was an incredible opportunity to show how UNESCO is sustainably helping arts and culture flourish around the world.</p>

<h2 class="heading-b heading-major">Outcome</h2>
<p>"Aaron was a true professional throughout the process and captured the spirit of each project. The films helped our efforts to communicate the impact that the International Fund for Cultural Diversity (IFCD) was making on the ground and to convince our Parties that their financial contributions supported sustainable projects."</p>
