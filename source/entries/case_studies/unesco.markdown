<h2 class="heading-b heading-major">Background</h2>
<p>This inspiring, large-scale, project took our cause-focused documentary work global. Producing films shot in Senegal, Argentina, and Croatia.</p>
<p>UNESCO's International Fund for Cultural Diversity (IFCD) selected us from 8 finalist agencies on 4 continents to embark on a global awareness-building campaign built around four documentary-shorts. 
</p>
<p>We traveled to four countries to produce four films, each of which have an English, Spanish and French version for a myriad of audiences, including a presentation of the films at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris. </p>
<p>Partnering with Austin Texas's Wyatt Brand for a global PR campaign, the films will reach the audience who needs to see them, decision-makers. 
</p>
<p>As our largest and most expansive project to date, it was an incredible opportunity to show how UNESCO is sustainably helping arts and culture flourish around the world. </p>
