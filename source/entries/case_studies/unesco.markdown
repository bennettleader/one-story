<h2 class="heading-b heading-major">Background</h2>
<p>UNESCO's International Fund for Cultural Diversity (IFCD) selected us from 8 finalist agencies on 4 continents to embark on a global awareness-building campaign built around four documentary-shorts. [LETS ADD SPECIFIC LOCATIONS TO THIS SOMEWHERE...]</p>
<p>We traveled to four countries to produce four films, each of which have an English, Spanish and French version for a myriad of audiences, including a presentation of the films at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris.</p>
<p>Partnering with Austin's Wyatt Brand for a global PR campaign, the films will reach the audience who needs to see them, decision-makers.</p>
<p>As our largest and most expansive project to date, it was an incredible opportunity to show how UNESCO is sustainably helping arts and culture flourish around the world.</p>
